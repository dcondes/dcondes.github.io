            <p><strong>Steve Jobs said </strong>, I think everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think. And I couldn't agree more.</p>
            <p>Since I have started to work in the Fintech sector I have been looking for some course or website where I could learn some basics about programming. </p>
            <p>I believe I am not doing well my job if I don't understand what I am talking about. First thing I did was asking to my CTO but he didn't know where to start. I understand when you spent years coding in different languages It difficult to choose.</p>
            <p>But one day, when I was checking my Instagram profile, an ad came to my timeline saying: Learn the basics of coding, and I clicked.</p>
            <p>And here is! Having no idea of coding I was able to deploy a very basic blog from scratch. For sure this could seem very easy for a developer but I am very proud of it!</p>

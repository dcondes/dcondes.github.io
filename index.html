            <p><strong>Steve Jobs said</strong>, "Everyone should learn to code because it helps you think. And I couldn't agree more. A large part of the population sees programming as rare. In fact, this is what the media has sold: a guy well into his kilos, with bags of chips, locked up in a room, who hates to interact with people. But programming definitely goes far beyond that. For me, understanding code, being able to play and try has allowed me to learn many more things. In a nutshell, these are the ones:</p>
            <p>1. Sort out the ideas: When we open an application, or a website, we think about the final result, but not. What lies behind it goes much further and has a complexity that the end user sometimes cannot imagine. Programming makes you develop abstract thinking, ordering ideas beyond what is seen "at first sight".</p>
            <p>2. Take your own life: There are universities and academies that teach programming, but let's not kid ourselves: to learn programming, our best school is always ourselves. When you have a problem and hit a wall head-on, the challenge is to know how to overcome it. And there isn't a manual that solves everything. You have to search, join possibilities, try, imagine, ask, and in the end you always see the light at the end of the tunnel. Programming helps you get your act together</p>
            <p>3.Thinking about new things: You can't start programming without an idea, without a goal, however small it may be. All programmers (or the vast majority) at some point in their lives have a project of their own in which they believe, which takes away a few hours a day, which robs them of sleep, to which they want to devote all their time. Programming forces you to innovate, and this is priceless.</p>
            <p>4. Strive for it:Nothing is easy, and programming is not easy either. You learn a language and it doesn't change anymore. Programming makes you familiar with many languages that are changing and adapting to what is happening. You may be an expert in one language, but in five years everything has changed and you may be forced to recycle. Reading, getting informed, not stopping are some of the things that go hand in hand with programming. And maybe that's what makes it exciting.</p>
            <p>5. Working as a team: It's you, but it may not be you alone. I'll explain myself. Yes, you can program in your room, but you know that you will have doubts, that you will want to ask questions, and that for projects that go beyond the anecdotal, you will have to find someone else. And this is magical. Programming has created large networks through, for example, Open Source. As Peter Sunde used to say when he was told about the "real world": "There is no real world, it is the Away From Keyboard (AFK) world, beyond the keyboard". I can't add anything more to this.</p>
            <p>These five points are some that come to mind when I think about what programming has contributed to me to date and will probably continue to contribute to me. It is a world to be discovered that should be, without a doubt, more valued. Let's program!</p>
